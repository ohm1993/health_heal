# `Health-heal` â€” A basic user interface between the client and the customer care service.

This project is an application for basic interaction between the user and the admin or curtomer care
service bor sending the feedback and complaints of anything.

The health-heal contains a sample Angularjs and Firebase appplication and is preconfigured to 
install the angular framework

The Health-heal app doesn't do much, only four modules are their in this project that is registration module,
login module,client module and fourth is Admin module.


## Getting Started

To get you started you can simply clone the `health_heal` repository and install the dependencies:

### Prerequisites

You need git to clone the `health_heal` repository. You can get git from [here][git].

We also use a number of Node.js tools to initialize and test `health_heal`. You must have Node.js
and its package manager (npm) installed. You can get them from [here][node].

### Clone `health_heal`

Clone the `angular-seed` repository using git:

```
https://github.com/ohm1993/health_heal.git
cd health_heal
```

If you just want to start a new project without the `health_heal` commit history then you can do:

```
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/ohm1993/health_heal.git <your-project-name>
```

The `depth=1` tells git to only pull down one commit worth of historical data.

### Install Dependencies

We have two kinds of dependencies in this project: tools and Angular framework code. The tools help
us manage and test the application.

* We get the tools we depend upon via `npm`, the [Node package manager][npm].
* We get the Angular code via `bower`, a [client-side code package manager][bower].
* In order to run the end-to-end tests, you will also need to have the
  [Java Development Kit (JDK)][jdk] installed on your machine. Check out the section on
  [end-to-end testing](#e2e-testing) for more info.

We have preconfigured `npm` to automatically run `bower` so we can simply do:

```
npm install
```

Behind the scenes this will also call `bower install`. After that, you should find out that you have
two new folders in your project.

* `node_modules` - contains the npm packages for the tools we need
* `app/bower_components` - contains the Angular framework files

*Note that the `bower_components` folder would normally be installed in the root folder but
`angular-seed` changes this location through the `.bowerrc` file. Putting it in the `app` folder
makes it easier to serve the files by a web server.*

### Run the Application

We have preconfigured the project with a simple development web server. The simplest way to start
this server is:

```
npm start
```

Now browse to the app at [`localhost:8000/index.html`][local-app-url].
